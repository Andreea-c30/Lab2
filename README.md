Laboratory work 2 Description

Working on this laboratory has allowed me to become acquainted with the oop concept encapsulation, as well as how to implement it and why it is important. In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class. Therefore, it increases the security of the data.

The request for this laboratory was to simulate a system using encapsulation without class interaction. Therefore, I created a model of a system that keeps track of the data for a school. Basically, a type of database for college where I created 10 entities such as: Students, Professors, Grades, Administration, Objects, Groups, Schedule, Exams, Admission, and Departments.

For each entity, I created a different class and put it in a different file so that the code is a bit more organized. The variables from the encapsulated classes have access protected and are accessed through setters and getters and then called in "Main" class where the main function can be found. Mostly I input data and then we have access to it, and in the future we will be able to do more operations with it. However, I did some logical operations in order to return the final grade, or using boolean data types to determine if the student has a scholarship or not, to determine whether he was financed by the state or by contract, and other math operations to return data about the grades, salary, contest grade, and so on.


The data I chose to show and return relates to the educational system, containing grades, general information about the students, professors, and the administration of a college. In this way, it allows us to manage to keep track of the statistics. In order to maintain a system, you have to collect and analyze the data, and this is why we need it.
